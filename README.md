# Music Level üéµ

An AI-powered music generation platform that allows users to create unique musical compositions using artificial intelligence. Built with a modern tech stack featuring NestJS backend and Next.js frontend.

## üåü Features

- **AI Music Generation**: Create unique music compositions using advanced AI algorithms
- **Multi-Instrument Support**: Generate music for piano, guitar, violin, flute, and drums
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login system with JWT tokens
- **Music Library**: Save, organize, and manage your generated compositions
- **MIDI Export**: Download compositions as standard MIDI files
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
- **Real-time Generation**: Live feedback during music creation process

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project follows a secure three-tier architecture with Next.js API routes acting as a proxy layer:

```
Frontend (React) ‚Üí Next.js API Routes ‚Üí NestJS Backend
```

```
music_level/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/          # NestJS API server
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/         # Next.js web application with API routes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md        # This file
```

### Security Benefits
- **Hidden Backend**: The NestJS backend URL is never exposed to the client
- **HTTP-Only Cookies**: JWT tokens are stored in secure HTTP-only cookies
- **Server-Side Validation**: Authentication is validated on the server side
- **Request Proxy**: All API requests go through Next.js API routes for additional security

### Backend (NestJS)
- **Framework**: NestJS with TypeScript
- **Database**: Appwrite for user management and file storage
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API for music generation
- **Authentication**: JWT with Passport.js
- **File Processing**: MIDI file generation and management
- **Security**: CORS configured to only allow Next.js frontend

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **UI Library**: React 19 with Tailwind CSS
- **API Layer**: Next.js API routes proxy all backend requests
- **Authentication**: HTTP-only cookies with server-side validation
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form
- **HTTP Client**: Axios (client-side only communicates with Next.js API routes)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Appwrite instance (for backend database)
- Google Gemini API key (for AI music generation)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amanbig/music_level.git
cd music_level
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Start the backend server
npm run start:dev
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your configuration

# Start the frontend development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## üîß Configuration

### Backend Environment Variables

```bash
# Server Configuration
PORT=8000
NODE_ENV=development

# Frontend URL for CORS
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
CORS_CREDENTIALS=true

# Appwrite Configuration
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://your-appwrite-endpoint
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-api-key
APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your-database-id
APPWRITE_USER_COLLECTION_ID=your-user-collection-id
APPWRITE_GENERATION_COLLECTION_ID=your-generation-collection-id
APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID=your-bucket-id

# Google Gemini API
GEMINI_API_URL=https://generativeai.googleapis.com/v1/models/gemini-pro
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-pro

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
```

### Frontend Environment Variables

```bash
# Backend API Configuration (Server-side only)
BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:8000  # NestJS backend URL for Next.js API routes
```

**Note**: The frontend uses Next.js API routes as a secure proxy layer. The `BACKEND_API_URL` is only used server-side and never exposed to the client.
